## Maze Generator and PathFinding Visualizer


### Pathfinding algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest path between two points avoiding obstacles.
##### In this Application, I implemented a recursive division maze and random maze generator algorithm.
##### I used weighted algorithms : Dijkstra, A* (Astar) and Greedy BFS.
##### And unweighted algorithms: Depth First Search, Breadth First Search.

##### NOTE : Dijkstra, A* (Astar) and Breadth First Search guarantee short path.
##### Greedy BFS and Depth First Search don't guarantee short path.


###### To use this application :
###### click on the grid to create walls, you can generate a maze
###### pick a pathfinding algorithm to start visualizing.
